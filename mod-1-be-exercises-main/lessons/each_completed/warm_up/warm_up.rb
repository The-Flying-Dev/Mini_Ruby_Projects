# Warm Up

# Take the next 2-3 minutes to look at the example below.
# In your notebook or in this file, write down your answers to the following
# questions.

# 1. What is the 'Collection'? # => In Ruby it is an Array or Hash that contains elements/data
# 2. What do you notice about the code below? # => Printing out each element according to it's index 
# 3. What issues could potentially crop up? # => If elements are removed or new elements are added then the indexes of the elements will change 
# 4. Is there an alternative you could propose? # => Iterate over the collection and print out the each element 

students = ["Megan", "Bob", "Mike"]
puts students[0]
puts students[1]
puts students[2]

# Go ahead and play in your terminal to see what the outputs are.
# After you take a guess, uncomment each `puts` one at a time.
# See if you were correct.
